<h2>#100 Nearer, My God, to Thee</h2>
<p>
  1. Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!<br />
  E'en though it be a cross<br />
  That raiseth me.<br />
  Still all my song shall be<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!
</p>

  1. Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!<br />
  E'en though it be a cross<br />
  That raiseth me.<br />
  Still all my song shall be<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!
</p>
<p>
  2. Though like the wanderer,<br />
  The sun gone down,<br />
  Darkness be over me,<br />
  My rest a stone;<br />
  Yet in my dreams I'd be<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!
</p>
<p>
  3. There let the way appear,<br />
  Steps unto heaven;<br />
  All that thou sendest me,<br />
  In mercy given;<br />
  Angels to beckon me<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!
</p>
<p>
  4. Then, with my waking thoughts<br />
  Bright with thy praise,<br />
  Out of my stony griefs<br />
  Bethel I'll raise;<br />
  So by my woes to be<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer, my God, to thee,<br />
  Nearer to thee!
</p>

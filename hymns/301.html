<h2>#301 I Am a Child of God</h2>
<p>
  1. I am a child of God,<br />
  And he has sent me here,<br />
  Has given me an earthly home<br />
  With parents kind and dear.
</p>
<p>
  Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,<br />
  Help me find the way.<br />
  Teach me all that I must do<br />
  To live with him someday.

<h2>#315 Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee</h2>
<p>
  1. Jesus, the very thought of thee<br />
  With sweetness fills my breast;<br />
  But sweeter far thy face to see<br />
  And in thy presence rest.
</p>
<p>
  2. Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,<br />
  Nor can the memâ€™ry find<br />
  A sweeter sound than thy blest name,<br />
  O Savior of mankind!
</p>
